# C++ Assignment - Univeristy Infomation
This is a C++ project (assignment) as a project under Programming 2 course with a high level of modularity.

"cli", "utils", and "course" modules were provided by the course personnel (responsible teacher: Maarit Harsu), howerver, those were slightly changed by me as per the requirements. Teachers instructions were taken before sharing the files here.

Major parts of the "account", "university" modules were developed by myself in order to implement 6 commands out of 15 of the program.

The program accepts commands from the user and responds accordingly. The user can input commands using a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters. The program checks the number of parameters provided and displays an error message if the amount is incorrect. The parameters can consist of course codes and account numbers. The program also handles unknown parameters and displays appropriate error messages. Commands already implemented include QUIT to terminate the program, NEW_ACCOUNT to create new user accounts, PRINT_ACCOUNT to retrieve information about a specific account, PRINT_ACCOUNTS to display information about all accounts, NEW_COURSE to create new courses, and ADD_STAFF to add teachers to specific courses.
